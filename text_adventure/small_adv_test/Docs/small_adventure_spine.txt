    logic
    map
    room connections
    script for game
Character
    Enemy
    NPC
        conversation
        trigger word
        blah blah treasure
Parser
    verbs
        go/walk
            can just use direction words (N,S,E,W,U,D. Any need for 8 cardinal points? Apart from added complexity?)
        get/take
        climb
        swim
        light (lantern)
        fight/attack/hit/kill
        search
            (NB shouldn't have to sift through stuff, obj shouldn't be too well hidden to notice)
        dig/shovel/uncover
        move
            (NB bit generic! Opens up too many complexities)
        throw
        rub
        push/pull
        open/close
        pour
        drink/eat
        unlock/lock
        press
        dial
        turn
        put
    nouns
        if 2 nouns: complex action (put THING on THING)
        
    nothing words
        a, an, the - knock em out to start
    prepositions
        bit annoying.
            into, on, through, between, among, etc
            intricate, maybe no use case apart from IN or ON or maybe UNDER
            PUT X IN Y (battery in torch)
            PUT X ON Y (record on gramophone)
        
    
dungeon
    rooms
        exits
            how to deal with adding exits/reciprocity of directions?
                added functionality later!
            method in Room to add?
            exits = {} empty dict
    connect the rooms
items
    gold
        special class - Treasure
    weapon
        special class
    key
    amulet
        magic item
    misc
        container
            flag (capacity - size of object it can contain. Any point?)
        lantern
            flag (lit/unlit. If room has unlit flag...)
            special class?
    backpack
    SPAWN method to put item HERE
    open object - SPAWN other object when CONDITION met
    break object - same as above. ie break coconut, spawn coconut milk.
        need to set attribute for these, or just special case functions in main game loop?
    WHERE IS OBJECT
        main loop has items dict for items. Each room is a key, values are a list of objects
        also chars dict for NPCs/enemies
basic functionality
    SAVE/RESTORE
        consider what info to save - items, inventory, current_room, score, hitpoints
        and once saved how to RESTORE... separate function to jump into main loop? where? how? Save/restore IN main loop?
